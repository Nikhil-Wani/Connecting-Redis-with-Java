### What is Redis

Redis is a NoSQL database which follows the principle of key-value store. The key-value store provides ability to store some data called a value, inside a key. You can recieve this data later only if you know the exact key used to store it.

Redis is a flexible, open-source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache, and message broker. Redis is a NoSQL database so it facilitates users to store huge amount of data without the limit of a Relational database.

Redis supports various types of data structures like strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.
